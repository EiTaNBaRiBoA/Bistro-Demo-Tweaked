For night time, we use non-realistic "filmic" values - brightness values are 10 times higher than the reference values.
Reference values for night time are 0.3 lux for the moon with a 4000k temp, and 0.09 nits for the sky. It goes much lower than that when it isn't a full moon, or if it's a cloudy night.
Godot can handle those values just fine... it's just that they don't look very good.

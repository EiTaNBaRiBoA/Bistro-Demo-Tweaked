## Tweaks:
1. Added anisotropic filtering.
2. Fixed up volumetric fog to use a height falloff approach.
3. Replaced SSAO with SSIL.
4. Configured glow for the Screen Blend Mode.
5. Set SDFGI to use a Compact Y Scale.
6. Changed lighting values to more closely resemble the [original Lumberyard demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXPA0LOf9JA).
